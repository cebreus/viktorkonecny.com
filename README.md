## Introduction

It is meant to be used for building static pages with full output control. Creates a bundled of the web page(s) with a style sheet(s), transpilled JavaScript for browsers and optimized images. It has development mode with hot-reload and production build.

When you want to build whole web pages from the data sources as API or bunch of the markdown files, Static Page Generators as [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) (VueJS), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (React) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go) will work for you much better. I prefer Gridsome or Hugo. Gridsome produces HTML files for every markdown file or API source and then in browser hydrates with javascript. The best solution for SEO.

### Typical use cases

-   Building landing pages.
-   Building prototypes.
-   Building the final output bundle for clients or programmers.
-   Optimize images.

### Key features

-   Separate tasks for developing `npm run develop` and final build `npm run build`.
-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) version 4 as a frontend framework.
-   [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as templating engine.
-   JSON as the main data source for templates (`<head />` etc.).
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) with PostCSS, Autoprefixer and other modules for SCSS processing.
-   Generates favicons.
-   Optimizes images.
-   Automatic formatting, linting and repair of source files — Eslint, Prettier, Stylelint, Textlint. Execution using npm scripts and automatically before committing.
-   [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow); [Semantic Commit Messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/); [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); Git submodule for the release process.
